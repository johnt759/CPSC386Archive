#### Overview of the game
Pig is a dice game where players take turn rolling the dice in order to score points. This game can be played against a computer player (if one player is selected) or as a hotseat game (if two, three, or four players are selected).

#### How to play
Each player takes turn rolling the dice. If the player rolls a 1, then the number of points the player could score is forfeited, and the next turn goes to the next player. Otherwise, if the player rolls a number other than a 1, then the player adds the dice value into the number of points. At this point, the player can choose whether to keep rolling the dice or hold and add points to total. Should the player chooses to hold, the player adds the number of points to their total score and their turn ends.

#### Winning the game
The game continues until one player scores at least 100 points. The first player to score 100 points wins the game.
